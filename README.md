# Nigeria Agriculatural Export Analysis
 A comprehensive analysis of the Nigeria Agricultural Export dataset

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the agricultural export data from Nigeria, providing insights into sales performance, time-series trends, cost analysis, geographic distribution, and product/company comparisons. The analysis is based on the nig_agric_exp dataset, which contains various attributes related to agricultural exports, including product information, company details, export destinations, sales figures, and profitability metrics.

## Dataset
The nigeria_agricultural_exports dataset consists of the following columns:

- Product Name: Name of the exported agricultural product.
- Company: Company responsible for the export.
- Export Country: Destination country for the export.
- Date: Date of the export transaction.
- Units Sold: Quantity of units sold for the given product.
- unit_price: Unit price of the product.
- Profit per unit: Profit generated per unit of the product.
- Export Value: Total revenue generated from the export.
- Destination Port: Port of destination for the export.
- Transportation Mode: Mode of transportation used for the export.

## Analysis
The analysis covers the following aspects:

1. Sales Performance:

- Top-selling products
- Company with the highest sales revenue
- Sales variations across export countries (product sales, average revenue, total units sold)
- Correlation between units sold and profit


2. Time-Series Analysis:

- Sales variations over time (monthly, quarterly, annually)
- Seasonal trends in sales
- Relationship between date of purchase and profit margin


3. Cost Analysis:

- Cost of goods sold (COGS) as a percentage of revenue
- COGS variation across products


4. Geographic Analysis:

- Destination ports with the highest export volume
- Common transportation modes for export
- Destination ports ranked by export value
- Top export product for each port


5. Performance Comparison:

- Product performance in terms of profit margin
- Company performance based on units sold and profit generated
- Identification of outliers or underperforming products/companies



## Visualizations
The analysis includes various visualizations to present the findings effectively, such as:

- Bar charts
- Line plots
- Scatter plots
- Heatmaps
- Tables
